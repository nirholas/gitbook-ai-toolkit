📄️ Asynchronous I/OAsynchronous I/O is a form of input/output processing that allows the CPU to continue executing concurrently while communication is in progress.📄️ PipeliningPipelining is a technique for implementing parallelism by dividing tasks into a series of smaller tasks which can be processed in parallel.
