## Documentation

📄️ VyperVyper is a popular programming language for the EVM that is logically similar to Solidity and syntactically similar with Python.📄️ YulYul is a intermediate language for Solidity that can generally be thought of as inline assembly for the EVM. It is not quite pure assembly, providing control flow constructs and abstracting away the inner working of the stack while still exposing the raw memory backend to developers. Yul is targeted at developers needing exposure to the EVM's raw memory backend to build high performance gas optimized EVM code.📄️ HuffHuff is most closely described as EVM assembly. Unlike Yul, Huff does not provide control flow constructs or abstract away the inner working of the program stack. Only the most upmost performance sensitive applications take advantage of Huff, however it is a great educational tool to learn how the EVM interprets instructions its lowest level.
