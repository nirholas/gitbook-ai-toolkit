## Documentation

On this page

Vyper is a popular programming language for the EVM that is logically similar to Solidity and syntactically similar with Python.
The Vyper documentation covers installing the Vyper language, language syntax, coding examples, compilation.
A typical EVM developer looking for a Python-like experience is encouraged to use Vyper as the programming language and ApeWorx, which leverages the Python language, as the testing and deployment framework. ApeWorx also allows for the use of typical Python libraries in analysis of testing results such as Pandas.
Vyper and ApeWorx can be used with Jupyter, which offers an interactive environment using a web browser.  A quick setup guide for working with Vyper and Jupyter for smart contract development for the EVM can be found here.
